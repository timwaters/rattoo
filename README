Rattoo

by tim waters

This is a Twitter Bot which is meant to be periodically called to tweet and send replies based on a radical text. It uses markov chains to detourn the text to possibly come up with interesting phrases.


It is written in Ruby, using the marky_markov and twitter gems.

To Run:

Either with a config file or Environment variables with the Twitter authentication text

Either have a config.yml file in the directory (see config.example.yml)
or use environment variables in your system with the same keys

For example for heroku:
heroku config:set CONSUMER_KEY=abc123
